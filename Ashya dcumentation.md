## Ashya: IoT devices registry on Blockchain 
###  A web application for registering IoT devices based on Blockchain.
At present, technologies development is accelerating and new techniques are emerging on a daily basis. The focus is largely on decentralized services because it ensures the rapid sharing of resources, speed of performance and efficiency while maintaining data integrity and confidentiality.
Blockchain is a very hot topic in the sense of data security and crypto payments. In this demo, we wanted to make an experimentation on using blockchain technology as enabler for IoT. The idea is to build a platform based on blockchain, where the users can subscribe to data stream generated by IoT devices and benefit .....

### To run this demo you need: 
- Raspberry Pi 3. You can order it from [here](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B07BFVYMJY/ref=asc_df_B07BFVYMJY58454054/?tag=googshopde-21&creative=22434&creativeASIN=B07BFVYMJY&linkCode=df0&hvadid=309008177512&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14415320193451425642&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061139&hvtargid=pla-436476818288&th=1&psc=1&tag=&ref=&adgrpid=65257070361&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvadid=309008177512&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14415320193451425642&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061139&hvtargid=pla-436476818288)
- A simple [webcam](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enDE756DE756&biw=1280&bih=578&tbm=shop&ei=7HBhXNGqKc2asAe42IfIDw&q=simple+web+camera+logitech&oq=simple+web+camera+logitech&gs_l=psy-ab.3...15777.17091.0.17342.7.7.0.0.0.0.120.542.6j1.7.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.pPMYop3Q7Lw#spd=15610673823399521644) 
- Download and install a compatible [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) version on your computer.

### 1- Setup your Raspberry Pi 3
#### 1.1 Install OS on the Raspberry Pi
1- Download the latest Raspbian stretch desktop image from [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)


2- Write the image to the SD card, You will need to use an image writing tool like [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to install the image you have downloaded on your SD card.

3- Connect an SD card reader with the SD card inside to your computer.

4- Open Etcher and select from your hard drive the Raspberry Pi .img or  .zip file you wish to write to the SD card.

5- Select the SD card you wish to write your image to.

6- Review your selections and click 'Flash!' to begin writing data to the SD card.

7- Once the flash completed, insert the SD card into your raspberry Pi and turn it on.

8- Connect your raspberry pi to the internet and enable SSh interface.

9- Get the IP address of your raspberry pi by running `ifconfig` in the terminal.

10- Save the IP address for later.

#### 1.2 Get [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) 

Our web application will run inside a docker container, so in order to be able to run the web application you need to download and install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) on your raspberry pi.

Alternatively, you can install docker by running this command in the terminal:

`sudo curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh`

Verify that Docker CE is installed correctly by running
`
$ sudo docker run hello-world
`

 When the container runs, it prints an informational message (Hello from Docker!) and exits.
 
 PS: don't forget to write sudo when running docker commands, else you will get permission denied error. 

### 2- Run the application 

#### 2.1 Get Metamask
Metamask is a browser extension provides a user interface to manage identities on different sites and sign blockchain transactions.
In this demo, every new device is represented by a smart contract. So we will use Metamask to enable us to deploy smart contracts on the blockchain and register devices to [Ashya.io](https://ashya.io/) to be visible for subscribers.

You can get the extension from [Metamask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn) 
A full guide for using Metamask you can find [here](https://medium.com/publicaio/a-complete-guide-to-using-metamask-updated-version-cd0d6f8c338f)

#### 2.2 Create an account on Kovan-testnetwork.

#### 2.3 Get some ether 
Once you create an account, get some fake ether from [Kovan testnet/Fauset](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/faucet) by signing in to this web site and posting your account address in the chat box you can request ether.

We now need to get the code from GitHub, in order to build our system. So first you will need to install Git in your Raspberry pi.

#### 2.4 SSH to Raspberry Pi
Establish SSH connection to your Raspberry Pi using PuTTY, insert the IP address of the raspberry pi in the host name field.

#### 2.5 Download Git on the Raspberry Pi
Run:

`sudo apt install git`


#### 2.6 Download this repository
On the command line go to a directory where you will remember (I use ~/Code for all my code, but feel free to customize as you desire),from there, run:

`git clone https://github.com/CiscoBlockChain/AshyaDeviceService.git `

This will download the entire repository you are currently reading.

Move to AshyaDeviceService by running 

`cd AshyaDeviceService`

Then run:

`sudo docker-compose up -d`
